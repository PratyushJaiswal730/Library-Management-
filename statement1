Author: PratyushJaiswal730
Date: 2025-11-24

Purpose:
This repository contains a Library Management System intended to provide a simple, maintainable solution for managing library resources including books, members, borrowing records, and administrative tasks. The system aims to demonstrate fundamental CRUD operations, user roles (admin, librarian, member), and basic reporting.

Scope:
- Maintain a catalog of books (add, edit, remove, search)
- Manage members and membership details
- Issue and return books with fine calculation for overdue items
- Basic user authentication and role-based access control
- Simple reporting for inventory and circulation

Goals:
- Provide a clear, well-documented codebase suitable for learning and demonstration
- Prioritize readability and modularity for future feature additions
- Include tests for core domain logic

How to contribute:
- Fork the repository and open pull requests for feature changes or bug fixes
- Follow established code style and include unit tests for new logic
- Open issues for discussion before implementing large changes

Notes:
- This statement is intentionally high-level. Detailed design decisions, data models, and API contracts should be documented in dedicated files (e.g., DESIGN.md, API.md) as the project evolves.
